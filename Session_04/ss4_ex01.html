    <h1>A few words about myself</h1>
    <p>Programming has changed my life in ways I never imagined. Before, I was struggling with jobs that did not bring me passion, but since learning programming, I realized that I can create great things with just a few lines of code. It not only helped me have a stable job with a good income, but also trained my logical thinking and problem-solving skills. More importantly, programming gave me the confidence to conquer challenges, opened the door to connect with like-minded people and gave me a sense of freedom in my work. Looking back, I know that the decision to learn programming was one of the best choices in my life.</p>
